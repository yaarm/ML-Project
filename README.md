# ML-Project

The notebook can be run using Google Colab. 
It contains 4 parts:
1. Models - contains the Deep Ensemble model and the Improved Deep Ensemble model.
2. Datasets - contains the loading of datasets and splitting to smaller datasets.
3. Cross validation - contains the cross validation of the 3 models: Deep Ensemble, Improved Deep Ensemble and Inception.
4. Evaluation - contains the tests to check if there are differences between the algorithms. Used the Friedman test and Post-Hoc test. Furthermore, we compared the running time of the Deep Ensemble model and the Improved Deep Ensemble model.

You can run the 3 first steps of the notebook - Models, Datasets and Cross validation. Then, the results for all the algorithms will be written to 3 different csv (in the related Google Drive). You can combine the 3 csv files to one called full_report and then run the fourth part of the Evaluation.
